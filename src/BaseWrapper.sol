/// -     The lender sends the funds to the wrapper.
/// -         The wrapper receives the callback from the lender.
/// -         The wrapper sends the funds to the loan receiver.
/// -         The wrapper calls the callback supplied by the original borrower.
/// -             The callback from the original borrower executes.
/// -         Depending on the lender, the wrapper may have to approve it to pull the repayment.
